## Will HEVC decoding be enabled in Chrome by default in the future?

Chrome Canary >= `107.0.5300.0` has already enable HEVC HW decoding support for ChromeOS, Mac, Windows and Android by default.
Chrome 107 release version will be available after `2022-10-25`.

## What's the hardware supported HEVC profile?

HEVC Main (Up to 8192x8192 pixels)

HEVC Main 10 (Up to 8192x8192 pixels)

HEVC Main Still Picture (macOS only, up to 8192x8192 pixels)

HEVC Rext (Partial support, see the table below for details, up to 8192x8192 pixels)

|        GPU             | 8b 420 | 8b 422 | 8b 444 | 10b 420 | 10b 422 | 10b 444 | 12b 420 | 12b 422 | 12b 444 |

✅：GPU + software support
⭕：GPU support, software not support
❌：GPU not support

#### Note 1：Intel CPU Mac supports HEVC Rext software decoding of 8 ~ 12b non-444 contents via VideoToolbox, 444 is decodable but has a green stripe issue.
#### Note 2：Specific Intel GPU supports HEVC Rext hardware decoding on Windows, so if you want to use these profiles then Chromium version must be >= 106.0.5210.0. Some profiles are not common so we only implement part of them, if you need those unsupported profile that GPU do supports, then you can submit a issue to `crbug.com`.
#### Note 3：Although NVIDIA GPU supports HEVC Rext hardware decoding of 8 ~ 12b non-422 contents via CUVIA or NVDEC, but because they did not provide a D3D11 interface, thus Chromium will not support it in the future.

## What's the OS requirement?

## How to verify certain profile or resolution is supported？

#### MediaCapabilities

```javascript
const mediaConfig = {
  /**
   * You can use `file` or `media-source` and the result are same here,
   * don't use `webrtc` since HEVC webrtc is not supported currently.
   */
  type: 'file',
  video: {
    /**
     * HEVC Profile
     * 
     * Main: `hev1.1.6.L93.B0`
     * Main 10: `hev1.2.4.L93.B0`
     * Main still-picture: `hvc1.3.E.L93.B0`
     * Range extensions: `hvc1.4.10.L93.B0`
     */
    contentType : 'video/mp4;codecs="hev1.1.6.L120.90"',
    /* Width */
    width: 1920,
    /* Height */
    height: 1080,
    /* Any number */
    bitrate: 10000, 
    /* Any number */
    framerate: 30
  }
}

navigator.mediaCapabilities.decodingInfo(mediaConfig)
  .then(result => {
     /* Indicate whether or not the video with given profile, width, and height can played well on the browser */
    if (result.supported) {
      console.log('Video can play!');
    } else {
      console.log('Video can\'t play!');
    }
  });
```

#### MediaSource

```javascript
if (MediaSource.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.1.6.L120.90"')) {
  console.log('HEVC main profile is supported!');
}

if (MediaSource.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.2.4.L120.90"')) {
  console.log('HEVC main 10 profile is supported!');
}

if (MediaSource.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.3.E.L120.90"')) {
  console.log('HEVC main still-picture profile is supported!');
}

if (MediaSource.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.4.10.L120.90"')) {
  console.log('HEVC range extensions profile is supported!');
}
```

#### CanPlayType

```javascript
const video = document.createElement('video');

if (video.canPlayType('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.1.6.L120.90"') === 'probably') {
  console.log('HEVC main profile is supported!');
}

if (video.canPlayType('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.2.4.L120.90"') === 'probably') {
  console.log('HEVC main 10 profile is supported!');
}

if (video.canPlayType('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.3.E.L120.90"') === 'probably') {
  console.log('HEVC main still-picture profile is supported!');
}

if (video.canPlayType('video/mp4;codecs="hev1.4.10.L120.90"') === 'probably') {
  console.log('HEVC range extensions profile is supported!');
}
```

#### Note 1：The above three API have already took `--disable-gpu`, `--disable-accelerated-video-decode`, `gpu-workaround`, `settings - system - Use hardware acceleration when available`, `OS version` etc... into consideration, and if Chrome version >= `107.0.5304.0` and OS is macOS or Windows, the result are guaranteed.
#### Note 2：Compared with `MediaSource.isTypeSupported()` or `CanPlayType()`, we recommand using `MediaCapabilities`, since `MediaCapabilities` not only takes `settings - system - Use hardware acceleration when available` etc... into consideration, but also check if the given `width and height` is supported or not since different GPU may have different max resolution support, eg: some AMD GPU only support up to 4096 * 2048, and some old GPU only support up to 1080P.

## What's the tech diff? (Compared with Edge / Safari)

#### Windows

Edge uses `VDAVideoDecoder` to call `MediaFoundation` (need to install `HEVC Video Extension`) to finish the HEVC HW decoding which is the same tech behind `Movies and TV` builtin system app.

Chromium uses `D3D11VideoDecoder` to call `D3D11VA` (no need to install anything) to finish the HEVC HW decoding which is the same tech behind video players like `VLC`.

#### macOS

Safari and Chromium use the same `VideoToolbox` to finish the HEVC HW decoding.

## How to verify HEVC hardware support is enabled?

1. Open `chrome://gpu`, and search `Video Acceleration Information`, you should see **Decode hevc main** field and **Decode hevc main 10** field  (macOS will show **Decode hevc main still-picture** and **Decode hevc range extensions** as well, Windows Intel Gen10+ iGPU will show **Decode hevc range extensions** as well)  present if hardware decoding is supported (macOS is an exception here, you see this field doesn't means the decode will use hardware, it actually depends on your GPU).
2. Open `chrome://media-internals` and play some HEVC video ([Test Page](https://lf-tk-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/tcs-client-sg/resources/video_demo_hevc.html)) if the decoder is `VDAVideoDecoder` or `D3D11VideoDecoder` or `VaapiVideoDecoder` that means the video is using hardware decoding (macOS is an exception here, if the OS >= Big Sur, and the GPU doesn't support HEVC, VideoToolbox will fallback to software decode which has a better performance compared with FFMPEG, the decoder is `VDAVideoDecoder` in this case indeed), and if the decoder is `FFMpegVideoDecoder` that means  the video is using software decoding.
3. Open `Activity Monitor` on Mac and search `VTDecoderXPCService`, if the cpu usage larger than 0 when playing video, that means hardware (or software) decoding is being used.
4. Open `Windows Task Manager` on Windows and switch to `Performance` - `GPU`, if `Video Decoding`(Intel, Nvidia) or `Video Codec`(AMD) usage larger than 0 when playing video,  that means hardware decoding is being used.

## Why my GPU support HEVC, but still not able to hardware decode?

#### OS version is too low

##### Windows

Please make sure you are using Windows 8 and above, this is because the `D3D11VideoDecoder` doesn't support Windows 7, and will use `VDAVideoDecoder` to hardware decoding. while `VDAVideoDecoder` based on `Media Foundation` , and `Media Foundation` start to support HEVC since Windows 10 1709 (which need you to install the `HEVC Video Extension`).

##### macOS

Please make sure you are using macOS Big Sur and above, this is because `CMVideoFormatDescriptionCreateFromHEVCParameterSets`  API has compatibility issue on lower macOS.

#### GPU driver has bug

Some GPU driver may has bug which will cause `D3D11VideoDecoder` forbidden to use. in this case, you need to upgrade your GPU driver and try again. [See reference](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:gpu/config/gpu_driver_bug_list.json?q=disable_d3d11_video_decoder)

#### GPU hardware has bug

Some GPU hardware may has bug which will cause `D3D11VideoDecoder` forbidden to use. in this case, we can't do anything else but to use the FFMPEG software decode. [See reference](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:gpu/config/gpu_driver_bug_list.json?q=disable_d3d11_video_decoder)

## How to Build?

1. Follow [the official build doc](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code/) to prepare the build environment then fetch the source code from `main` branch (HEVC HW codes has been merged).
2. (Optional) To enable HEVC software decoding: switch to `src/third_party/ffmpeg` dir, then execute `git am /path/to/add-hevc-ffmpeg-decoder-parser.patch`.
3. (Optional) To enable other HEVC profiles (non main / main 10 profiles): switch to `src` dir, then execute `git am /path/to/remove-main-main10-profile-limit.patch`.
4. (Optional) To integrate Widevine CDM to support EME API (like Netflix): switch to `src` dir, then execute `cp -R /path/to/widevine/* third_party/widevine/cdm` (Windows: `xcopy /path/to/widevine third_party\widevine\cdm /E/H`).
5. If you are using `Mac` + want to build `x64` arch (target_cpu to `x86` , `arm64` , `arm` also available) + want to add CDM support, then run `gn gen out/Release64 --args="is_component_build = false is_official_build = true is_debug = false ffmpeg_branding = \"Chrome\" target_cpu = \"x64\" proprietary_codecs = true media_use_ffmpeg = true enable_widevine = true bundle_widevine_cdm = true enable_platform_hevc = true enable_hevc_parser_and_hw_decoder = true"`, if you are using `Windows`, you need to add `enable_media_foundation_widevine_cdm = true` as well, if you are using `Windows` and want to build `arm64` arch, then need to change `bundle_widevine_cdm` to `false`.
6. Run `autoninja -C out/Release64 chrome` to start the build.
7. Open Chromium directly.

## How to integrate this into Chromium based project like Electron?

If Electron >= v20.0.0 (Chromium >= v104.0.5084.0), the HEVC hw decoding feature for Mac and Windows should have already been integrated, and you can use `app.commandLine.appendSwitch('enable-features', 'PlatformHEVCDecoderSupport')` to enable HEVC hw decoding. To add HEVC ffmpeg sw decoding, the method should be the same with Chromium guide above.

If Electron < v20.0.0, please follow the CL in `Trace Crbug` to manually integrate HEVC features. Pull request of Patches for different version of Electron are welcome.
